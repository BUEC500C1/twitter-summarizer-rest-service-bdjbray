# MultiProcessing

### Pros

Separate memory space\\
Code is usually straightforward
Takes advantage of multiple CPUs & cores
Avoids GIL limitations for cPython
Eliminates most needs for synchronization primitives unless if you use shared memory (instead, it's more of a communication model for IPC)
Child processes are interruptible/killable
Python multiprocessing module includes useful abstractions with an interface much like threading.Thread
A must with cPython for CPU-bound processing
